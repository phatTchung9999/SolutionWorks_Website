# SolutionWorks

SolutionWorks is a non-profit web project that I am building to help small local businesses run their own websites for free.

The goal of SolutionWorks is to support local communities by providing simple, ready-to-use website templates for small businesses such as barbershops, nail salons, and restaurants. These templates will include practical features like appointment booking, basic business information, and service listings.

Through SolutionWorks, local business owners can choose a template that fits their needs, and I help them set up a professional website without cost or technical barriers. This project is focused on accessibility, simplicity, and real-world usefulness rather than profit.

SolutionWorks is founded and developed by **Phat Chung**

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Local businesses choose a website template that matches their business type.
2. Templates include features such as appointment booking, service display, and contact information.
3. I help configure and deploy the website for the business at no cost.
4. The business receives a functional and professional website they can use immediately.
5. I remain available to support the business whenever they need help.

## 🏪 Supported Business Types (Planned)

- Barbershops (appointment booking)
- Nail salons (service and booking pages)
- Restaurants (menu display and contact pages)
- Other small local businesses in the future
